## Overview <a name="overview"></a>
The Quander Realm is a hub world that holds and manages the various minigames in this project.

The project files are split into three main areas under the `Assets` folder.

- Code
	- C\# code files that add behavior to game objects and do background work.
- Levels
	- A "level" in this context is an area of Quander that is loaded independently (i.e., each minigame).
	- Contains prefabs of game objects and scenes found in that level.
- Resources
	- Art, sound files, textures, dialogue, etc.
	- Basically anything else.

Then each of those three main areas are split into the area Quander that they affect.

- Common -- Shared code/assets used by more than one level.
- World -- The "hub" world and main menu.
- BuriedTreasure -- Buried treasure hunt with Wane.
- TanglesLair -- Circuit simplification game.
- TwinTanglement -- Maze solving with Fran and Ken.
- Qupcakery -- Cupcake gate problem solving.
- Queuebits -- Connect four with qubits.
